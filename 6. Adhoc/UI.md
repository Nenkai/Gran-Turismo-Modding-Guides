# 6.3 - Adhoc UI Editing
Adhoc has its own full fledged UI framework, on-part with the layout definitions you can see with [QT](https://www.qt.io/) and [XAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/xaml) production quality wise.

They are defined in those `.mproject/.mwidget` files. From GT4 to GT5 1.00 they are in plaintext, and later on were changed to binary formats for performance purposes. 

All games in the series still support loading the files's text version, and [GTAdhocTools](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTAdhocTools) can convert those files back into their text versions just by dragging a `.mproject` or `.mwidget` file onto it.

Widgets themselves are documented [here](https://github.com/Nenkai/GT-File-Specifications-Documentation/tree/master/Docs/UIDocs).
